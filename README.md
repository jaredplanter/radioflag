# Notes
* All of my comments are in my git commits. I like to write my ruby in a way that is "self documenting", however I do write extensive notes in my git commits
* All of the API calls to MusixMatch are happening through a MusixMatch gem (library) that I found and editting for my use. The majority of the work for this project was done in that gem. You can find the gem here https://github.com/jaredplanter/musix_match and you will see that the latest commits are mine. Please review them to see the code.
